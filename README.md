# LinkedList-in-C
My attempt on a linked list structure in C. The values of each node must be strings.

### Functions:
addNodeFront: adds a new node at the front of the list\n
addNodeBack: add a new node at the end of the list\n
removeNodeFront: remove the first node\n
removeNodeBack: remove the last node\n
addNodeAfter: takes a search string and adds a new node after the node with data that matches the search string\n
removeNode: removes a node with the data that is passed into the function\n
getFrontText: prints the data of the first element in the list\n
