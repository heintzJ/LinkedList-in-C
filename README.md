# LinkedList-in-C
My attempt on a linked list structure in C. The values of each node must be strings.

### Functions:
addNodeFront: adds a new node at the front of the list

addNodeBack: add a new node at the end of the list

removeNodeFront: remove the first node

removeNodeBack: remove the last node

addNodeAfter: takes a search string and adds a new node after the node with data that matches the search string

removeNode: removes a node with the data that is passed into the function

getFrontText: prints the data of the first element in the list
